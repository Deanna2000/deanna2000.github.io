                    I'm Deanna, a product owner/project manager working on custom software projects in Nashville, Tennessee. I really enjoy working with others in the tech community to increase "humanity" among my peers and share our skills together on endeavors that help people. I volunteer for many tech events locally but I am currently most involved with Music City Code - an amazing developer conference in its fourth year in Nashville.
                    
                    I'm also the creator of an app that my friends are  helping me bring to life. It's called <a href="http://www.doodrop.io">Doo Drop</a> and I would love for connect with you to talk about it. It's for dog lovers - it provides support to be a better dog friend and have fun while you're doing that. You can find walking routes, dog parks, trash cans, water stops and also connect with other dog friends in your area to share walking, sitting, recommendations and support for lost/found animals. If you love dogs, you'll love this app!
                    
                    In addition to volunteering and being a creator of apps, I also love cooking, playing guitar, being outside and traveling.
