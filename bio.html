                    I'm Deanna, a product owner/project manager working on custom software projects in Nashville, Tennessee. 
                    
                    
                    I'm on a personal mission to make the tech community more open and friendly. I volunteer for many tech events locally including <a href http://www.musiccitycode.com>Music City Code</a>, <a href http://www.womengetit.net>WomenGetIT</a> and <a href http://www.nodevember.com>Nodevember</a>. 
                    
                    I'm also the creator of an app that my friends are  helping me bring to life. It's called <a href="http://www.doodrop.io">Doo Drop</a> and I would love for connect with you to talk about it. It's for dog lovers - it provides support to be a better dog friend and have fun while you're doing that. You can find walking routes, dog parks, trash cans, water stops and also connect with other dog friends in your area to share walking, sitting, recommendations and support for lost/found animals. If you love dogs, you'll love this app!
                    
                    In addition to volunteering and being a creator of apps, I also love cooking, playing guitar, being outside and traveling.
