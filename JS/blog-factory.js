At that time she was working at our local university part time as a key punch operator and she worked there throughout my childhood and high school years. For some reason I kept choosing to do things that were not quite technology yet I was usually the person in the office who became the tech expert at whatever we were using. My career did eventually turn to technology fully when I became a project manager. I began working full time with clients who needed products and developers who were making them. I had so much fun watching these ideas come to life and I have been encouraging other friends to consider learning development for a career. After a few years of debating about it, I decided to go beyond my small attempts to learn to code and do it full time as part of a bootcamp. I'm so thrilled to be here and plan to see it through no matter how tough it gets."

    "content": "I am so impressed with the way we are being taught. The experience here at bootcamp is exceptionally well thought out and it's covering all the aspects of being a developer. My favorite thing that our intructor, Steve, told us was 'anyone can do this, anyone.' I went to a dev conference for 2 days this week and it was so much fun. I'm now getting to experience them in a more meaningful way; I even got to spend a few hours pairing with another developer to help me with some homework!"

    "date": "Week 3 - October 20",
    "content": "Things are beginning to get very complex and I'm understanding about 30% of it. But I'm not going to let it get me down, I'll just keep plugging away at my own pace and focus on putting the pieces together. I'm already feeling pretty good about using git and github so that's a huge help. Last week and this week we split up into small groups to work on projects. I'm finding everyone in the class to be really fun to work with - I guess that's a product of people who are invested in learning together."
