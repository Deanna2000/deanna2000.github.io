                I'm Deanna, an aspiring developer. My goal as a developer is to bridge the gap of communication that exists on teams between technical and non-technical team members and stakeholders. 
                This ties directly to my personal mission of making the tech community more open and welcoming. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I volunteer for many tech events locally including <a href= "http://www.musiccitycode.com">Music CityCode</a>, 
                <a href="http://www.womengetit.net">WomenGetIT</a> and <a href=" 
                http://www.nodevember.com">Nodevember</a>. 

                <p class = "bioemphasis">You should join me!</p>
                
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm also the creator of an app that my friends are  helping me bring to life. It's called
                 <a href="http://www.doodrop.io">Doo Drop</a> and I would love to connect with you to 
                 talk about it. It's for dog lovers - it provides support to be a better dog friend and 
                 have fun while you're doing that. You can find walking routes, dog parks, trash cans, 
                 water stops and also connect with other dog friends in your area to share walking, 
                 sitting, recommendations and support for lost/found animals. If you love dogs, you'll 
                 love this app!
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to volunteering and being a creator of apps, I also love cooking, playing 
                guitar, being outside and traveling.
